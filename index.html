              Just Go was a personal idea that was able
              to come to life with some help from some
              classmates. Before I started learning about
              the intricacies of coding I was writing down
              ideas of things I wanted to make, this
              social media travel website was one of them.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-margin">
              Just Go was a project that I was able to
              lead in designing the interface and
              collaborating with the user experience. Our
              goal with the project was to make it simple
              and fun to use. We didn’t want the site to be
              too flashy or over the top either because the
              story that the image was telling was more
              important.
            </p>

            <h6 class="caption">detail of user post</h6>
            <p>
              In addition to creating the design of the app,
              we were also the ones responsible for taking
              the designs and creating a functional site.
              We built it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
              Vue.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

              Though I feel like there is always more work
              that could be done to improve, my team and
              I were very pleased with the product that
              we were able to create together!

              Keepr is a pinterest-like website where users
              come to get new ideas and share images
              that they like. Users can ‘keep’ other user
              posts in their ‘vaults’ and store them away for
              when they want to access them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on this project solo, and again
              wanted to create a simple color palette and
              layout as not to distract from the content that
              users create.
            </p>
            <p>
              The images that are posted keep a count of
              how many people viewed it and have kept it
              into one of their vaults. Users also have the
              option to share the keep on their Facebook
              wall.

              This project was completed with one other
              person. We brainstormed ideas and came up
              with a fun and retro balloon theme. I was able
              to test my skill with Photoshop and edit some
              graphics to create the perfect balloon scene
              for the home page.

              Cuisine Seen is an application that I am still in the process of creating. I started out with a problem
              that I
              experience in my own life - figuring out what to cook each day. Something seemly simple can be hard to
              manage when
              you don't have ample amounts of time on your hands.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-margin">
              With Cuisine Seen, I wanted the application to be a one stop spot for users to be able to create their own
              cookbooks, add their own or other peoples recipes to their cookbook(s), create a weekly or monthly meal
              plan, and
              create a shopping list.
            </p>

            <h6 class="caption">home page recipe search</h6>
            <p>
              I also wanted to get a good idea of who would be using this application. Probably someone like me? Someone
              who
              wants to be able to save time with their meal prep. I determined that the average user would be someone
              like Kelly
              here:

            <h6 class="caption">user persona: Kelly</h6>
            <p>
              I wanted the style of the application to clean and simple. I didn't want people to have to be distracted
              by a lot
              of menus or lists.
            </p>

              Choosing very appealing photos was also a very important part of the design. When food is photographed
              well, it
              looks way more appetizing.
